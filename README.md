This repo contains the code for building an alteranative risk assessment score model to predict recidivism rates and comparing the results of a new stacking model (random forest and xgboost) with the COMPAS scoring model in the hope of building a fairer model. 
It also contains a pdf which shows the results of the model and its comparison with the COMPAS model.
